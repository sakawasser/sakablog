Students optimize their lives in a way that will result in better performance from exams for 12 years. It is why the majority of the graduates are literal morons.

They don't measure knowledge or creativity.


They simply measure discipline * intelligence but ther are way better ways to do it.
But probably blank slaters wouldn't let us to do IQ tests.
