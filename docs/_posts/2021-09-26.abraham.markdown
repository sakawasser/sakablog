There is no difference between the past and the present, between Abraham and you.


The responsibility of choice–to believe or not to believe, to act or not to act—is always individual.


In reality, what Abraham did would horrify you, and the reason it doesn't is because you make excuses.


You think the times were so different that what he did could be explained by that fact alone. Instead, you should view it as if it happened yesterday.


“It is repugnant to me to do as so often is done, namely, to speak inhumanly about a great deed, as though some thousands of years were an immense distance,” Kierkegaard wrote in “Fear and Trembling.”
 
 
“I would rather speak humanly about it, as though it had occurred yesterday.”
