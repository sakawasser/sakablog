The more portable an asset is the more freedom it can force.


Land is not portable, thus autocratic control over land is common.


Capital & equipment is slightly more portable, but still big, clunky and more & more complex from an industrial scale.


This gives more freedom to owners of the equipment as they are able to move it or more of it under times of duress.


Assets like commodities & raw materials, oil, food, metals, silicone are more portable than capital and equipment. They are also required in order to function.


This requirement and imposition allows for more freedom for individuals within systems.


Then there is the next level, which is small precious metals and high desirability items like gold, silver, diamonds, precious stones, antiques, collectables.
These are stores of value that are very portable and transferable. This is why they have been used as currencies throughout time.
They are also why free societies use them. As they give the owners of these products the maximum amount of personal freedom.

However with the digital age, there is another level of portability and scarcity. Which is crypto, as crypto is portable, transferable and impossible to control anywhere in the world.
Which is why it forces the maximum amount of freedom to those who hold it.


Society goes through a cycle of economic freedom > creating wealth, however wealth creation comes with resentment of those who cannot.
This resentment is stoked by those who seek power. Those who are resentful, get the government to redistribute wealth.


From the productive to the non-productive, through debt and eventually currency manipulation. 

Resentment itself is maintained through debt and currency debasement, however as all delusions, this ends as the currency debasement goes until the capital itself,
Goes back into the hands of the productive. The autocratic nature of this cycle is what destroys, but you cannot fight reality. Resources will naturally find a way to the hands of the most productive. Even in the most communist of autocracies.
Those who are aware of this cycle convert into the assets that prevents the autocrats from doing this eventually are rewarded with the wealth transfer that occurred through them, back to them. This is what will happen with commodities and crypto in the next decade to come.
This will maximize your freedom, while minimizing autocratic power.

Those who create, can now be protected by those that destroy and be rewarded for doing so.
Money printing is how autocratic governments now extract tribute from those who are subservient to them. There is no longer a risk of confiscation, or bank runs. The real danger is resentment and those who stoke it.

Those who have assets that cannot be printed, will be rewarded.
