What a shameless generation this is.


Girls are crying in a mirror to see if they look cute.


Boys are being degenerates in the name of being open-minded.


Atheists are throwing away religion without replacing it with something more productive.


Sometimes I ran out of words. How can they live with this stupidity?

Don't they sit down and think? Even for a minute?
