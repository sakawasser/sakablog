I think it is very likely that we live in a simulation.


We can program electrical devices and also we can program biological entities.

What is the difference between you and an AI?

You are based on carbon and your source code is in your blood. AI is based on electricity and its source code is in a computer.


Spirit, soul, free will...


They don't exist.
