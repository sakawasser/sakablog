“In solitude, the lonely man is eaten by himself. Among crowds, by the many."

― Friedrich Nietzsche




Intellectual loneliness is the deficiency of mental stimulation. While many live their lives without thinking about life and death, even a second, the thinkers are the ones who build civilizations. 
Thinkers are cognitively gifted and this is the main reason why thinkers are lonely. People do not choose not to think, they simply cannot think. They cannot systemize knowledge as we do, and they cannot detect the pattern that we see everywhere in our universe.
This fact may drag you to misanthropy, or you might think that I am a narcissistic asshole. Truth hurts and you need to press where it hurts.
Also, I think the worst trait an intellectual can get is being undisciplined.
