1. Be disciplined, do what you think you should do.
2. Stop overthinking, don't plan a big battle just go guerila mode.


If these are not working for you, boost your testosterone. (if you are a male)
Go lift some weights, lower your body fat percentage, sleep well.
Stop using sugar, talk to girls.


and an underrated advice:


stop listening shitty music, fuck xxxtentacion all my homies listen burzum
