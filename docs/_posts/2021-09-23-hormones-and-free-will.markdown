Effortlessly sad, lethargic and unmotivated: shit hormones


Effortlessly happy, energetic and motivated: good hormones This simple.



People who have never manipulated their hormones assign their feelings and productivity to some kind of spiritual shit But it's basically hormones.
It is not about free will because free will doesn't exist. Life is a lottery.
All hail testosterone!
